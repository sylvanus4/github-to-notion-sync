description: >-
  Review code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and
  maintainability. Trigger with "review this code", "check this PR", "look at
  this diff", "is this code safe?", or when the user shares code and asks for
  feedback. Do NOT use for this project's FastAPI/Go service patterns — prefer
  backend-expert or security-expert skill. Korean triggers: "코드 리뷰", "PR 리뷰".

# Code Review

Structured code review covering security, performance, correctness, and maintainability. Works on diffs, PRs, files, or pasted code snippets.

## Review Dimensions

### Security
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Secrets or credentials in code
- Insecure deserialization
- Path traversal
- SSRF

### Performance
- N+1 queries
- Unnecessary memory allocations
- Algorithmic complexity (O(n²) in hot paths)
- Missing database indexes
- Unbounded queries or loops
- Resource leaks

### Correctness
- Edge cases (empty input, null, overflow)
- Race conditions and concurrency issues
- Error handling and propagation
- Off-by-one errors
- Type safety

### Maintainability
- Naming clarity
- Single responsibility
- Duplication
- Test coverage
- Documentation for non-obvious logic

## Output Format

Rate each dimension and provide specific, actionable findings with file and line references. Prioritize critical issues first. Always include positive observations alongside issues.

## Examples

### Example 1: Typical request

**User says:** "I need help with engineering code review"

**Actions:**
1. Ask clarifying questions to understand context and constraints
2. Apply the domain methodology step by step
3. Deliver structured output with actionable recommendations

### Example 2: Follow-up refinement

**User says:** "Can you go deeper on the second point?"

**Actions:**
1. Re-read the relevant section of the methodology
2. Provide detailed analysis with supporting rationale
3. Suggest concrete next steps
## Error Handling

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Missing required context | Ask user for specific inputs before proceeding |
| Skill output doesn't match expectations | Re-read the workflow section; verify inputs are correct |
| Conflict with another skill's scope | Check the "Do NOT use" clauses and redirect to the appropriate skill |
