## KWP Operations: Process Doc

Document a business process — flowcharts, RACI, and SOPs.

# /process-doc


Document a business process as a complete standard operating procedure (SOP).

## Usage

```
/process-doc $ARGUMENTS
```

## How It Works

Walk me through the process — describe it, paste existing docs, or just tell me the name and I'll ask the right questions. I'll produce a complete SOP.

## Output

```markdown
## Process Document: [Process Name]
**Owner:** [Person/Team] | **Last Updated:** [Date] | **Review Cadence:** [Quarterly/Annually]

### Purpose
[Why this process exists and what it accomplishes]

### Scope
[What's included and excluded]

### RACI Matrix
| Step | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| [Step] | [Who does it] | [Who owns it] | [Who to ask] | [Who to tell] |

### Process Flow
[ASCII flowchart or step-by-step description]

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1: [Name]
- **Who**: [Role]
- **When**: [Trigger or timing]
- **How**: [Detailed instructions]
- **Output**: [What this step produces]

#### Step 2: [Name]
[Same format]

### Exceptions and Edge Cases
| Scenario | What to Do |
|----------|-----------|
| [Exception] | [How to handle it] |

### Metrics
| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|

## If Connectors Available

If **Notion** is connected:
- Search for existing process documentation to update rather than duplicate
- Publish the completed SOP to your wiki

If **Linear** is connected:
- Link the process to related projects and workflows
- Create tasks for process improvement action items

## Tips

1. **Start messy** — You don't need a perfect description. Tell me how it works today and I'll structure it.
2. **Include the exceptions** — "Usually we do X, but sometimes Y" is the most valuable part to document.
3. **Name the people** — Even if roles change, knowing who does what today helps get the process right.
