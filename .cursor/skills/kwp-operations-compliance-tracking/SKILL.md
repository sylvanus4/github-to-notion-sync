Help track compliance requirements, prepare for audits, and maintain regulatory readiness.

## Common Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Key Requirements |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| SOC 2 | Service organizations | Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy |
| ISO 27001 | Information security | Risk assessment, security controls, continuous improvement |
| GDPR | Data privacy (EU) | Consent, data rights, breach notification, DPO |
| HIPAA | Healthcare data (US) | PHI protection, access controls, audit trails |
| PCI DSS | Payment card data | Encryption, access control, vulnerability management |

## Compliance Tracking Components

### Control Inventory
- Map controls to framework requirements
- Document control owners and evidence
- Track control effectiveness

### Audit Calendar
- Upcoming audit dates and deadlines
- Evidence collection timelines
- Remediation deadlines

### Evidence Management
- What evidence is needed for each control
- Where evidence is stored
- When evidence was last collected

### Gap Analysis
- Requirements vs. current state
- Prioritized remediation plan
- Timeline to compliance

## Output

Produce compliance status dashboards, gap analyses, audit prep checklists, and evidence collection plans.
