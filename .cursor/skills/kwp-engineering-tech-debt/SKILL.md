  when the user asks about code quality, refactoring priorities, or maintenance
  backlog. Do NOT use for this project's specific refactoring patterns — prefer
  backend-expert or frontend-expert skill. Korean triggers: "기술 부채", "리팩토링".

# Tech Debt Management

Systematically identify, categorize, and prioritize technical debt.

## Categories

| Type | Examples | Risk |
|------|----------|------|
| **Code debt** | Duplicated logic, poor abstractions, magic numbers | Bugs, slow development |
| **Architecture debt** | Monolith that should be split, wrong data store | Scaling limits |
| **Test debt** | Low coverage, flaky tests, missing integration tests | Regressions ship |
| **Dependency debt** | Outdated libraries, unmaintained dependencies | Security vulns |
| **Documentation debt** | Missing runbooks, outdated READMEs, tribal knowledge | Onboarding pain |
| **Infrastructure debt** | Manual deploys, no monitoring, no IaC | Incidents, slow recovery |

## Prioritization Framework

Score each item on:
- **Impact**: How much does it slow the team down? (1-5)
- **Risk**: What happens if we don't fix it? (1-5)
- **Effort**: How hard is the fix? (1-5, inverted — lower effort = higher priority)

Priority = (Impact + Risk) x (6 - Effort)

## Output

Produce a prioritized list with estimated effort, business justification for each item, and a phased remediation plan that can be done alongside feature work.

## Examples

### Example 1: Typical request

**User says:** "I need help with engineering tech debt"

**Actions:**
1. Ask clarifying questions to understand context and constraints
2. Apply the domain methodology step by step
3. Deliver structured output with actionable recommendations

### Example 2: Follow-up refinement

**User says:** "Can you go deeper on the second point?"

**Actions:**
1. Re-read the relevant section of the methodology
2. Provide detailed analysis with supporting rationale
3. Suggest concrete next steps
## Error Handling

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Missing required context | Ask user for specific inputs before proceeding |
| Skill output doesn't match expectations | Re-read the workflow section; verify inputs are correct |
| Conflict with another skill's scope | Check the "Do NOT use" clauses and redirect to the appropriate skill |
