  Write and maintain technical documentation. Trigger with "write docs for",
  "document this", "create a README", "write a runbook", "onboarding guide", or
  when the user needs help with any form of technical writing — API docs,
  architecture docs, or operational runbooks. Do NOT use for ADRs, changelogs,
  or project-specific docs — prefer technical-writer skill. Korean triggers:
  "기술 문서", "문서화".

# Technical Documentation

Write clear, maintainable technical documentation for different audiences and purposes.

## Document Types

### README
- What this is and why it exists
- Quick start (< 5 minutes to first success)
- Configuration and usage
- Contributing guide

### API Documentation
- Endpoint reference with request/response examples
- Authentication and error codes
- Rate limits and pagination
- SDK examples

### Runbook
- When to use this runbook
- Prerequisites and access needed
- Step-by-step procedure
- Rollback steps
- Escalation path

### Architecture Doc
- Context and goals
- High-level design with diagrams
- Key decisions and trade-offs
- Data flow and integration points

### Onboarding Guide
- Environment setup
- Key systems and how they connect
- Common tasks with walkthroughs
- Who to ask for what

## Principles

1. **Write for the reader** — Who is reading this and what do they need?
2. **Start with the most useful information** — Don't bury the lede
3. **Show, don't tell** — Code examples, commands, screenshots
4. **Keep it current** — Outdated docs are worse than no docs
5. **Link, don't duplicate** — Reference other docs instead of copying

## Examples

### Example 1: Typical request

**User says:** "I need help with engineering documentation"

**Actions:**
1. Ask clarifying questions to understand context and constraints
2. Apply the domain methodology step by step
3. Deliver structured output with actionable recommendations

### Example 2: Follow-up refinement

**User says:** "Can you go deeper on the second point?"

**Actions:**
1. Re-read the relevant section of the methodology
2. Provide detailed analysis with supporting rationale
3. Suggest concrete next steps
## Error Handling

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Missing required context | Ask user for specific inputs before proceeding |
| Skill output doesn't match expectations | Re-read the workflow section; verify inputs are correct |
| Conflict with another skill's scope | Check the "Do NOT use" clauses and redirect to the appropriate skill |
