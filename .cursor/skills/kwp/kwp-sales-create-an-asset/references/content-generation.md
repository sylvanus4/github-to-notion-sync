# Phase 3: Content Generation

### General Principles

All content should:
- Reference **specific pain points** from user input or transcripts
- Use **prospect's language** — their terminology, their stated priorities
- Map **seller's product** → **prospect's needs** explicitly
- Include **proof points** where available (case studies, metrics, quotes)
- Feel **tailored, not templated**

---

### Section Templates

#### Hero / Intro
```
Headline: "[Prospect's Goal] with [Seller's Product]"
Subhead: Tie to their stated priority or top industry challenge
Metrics: 3-4 key facts about the prospect (shows we did homework)
```

#### Their Priorities (if discovery follow-up)
```
Reference specific pain points from conversation:
- Use their exact words where possible
- Show we listened and understood
- Connect each to how we help
```

#### Solution Mapping
```
For each pain point:
├── The challenge (in their words)
├── How [Product] addresses it
├── Proof point or example
└── Outcome / benefit
```

#### Use Cases / Demos
```
3-5 relevant use cases:
├── Visual mockup or interactive demo
├── Business impact (quantified if possible)
├── "How it works" — 3-4 step summary
└── Relevant to their industry/role
```

#### ROI / Business Case
```
Interactive calculator with:
├── Inputs relevant to their business (from research)
│   ├── Number of users/developers
│   ├── Current costs or time spent
│   └── Expected improvement %
├── Outputs:
│   ├── Annual value / savings
│   ├── Cost of solution
│   ├── Net ROI
│   └── Payback period
└── Assumptions clearly stated (editable)
```

#### Why Us / Differentiators
```
├── Differentiators vs. alternatives they might consider
├── Trust, security, compliance positioning
├── Support and partnership model
└── Customer proof points (logos, quotes, case studies)
```

#### Next Steps / CTA
```
├── Clear action aligned to Purpose (c)
├── Specific next step (not vague "let's chat")
├── Contact information
├── Suggested timeline
└── What happens after they take action
```

### Workflow Demo Content

#### Component Definitions

For each system, define:

```yaml
component:
  id: "snowflake"
  label: "Snowflake Data Warehouse"
  type: "database"  # database | api | ai | middleware | human | document | output
  icon: "database"
  description: "Financial performance data"
  brand_color: "#29B5E8"
```

**Component types:**
- `human` — Person initiating or receiving
- `document` — PDFs, contracts, files
- `ai` — AI/ML models, agents
- `database` — Data stores, warehouses
- `api` — APIs, services
- `middleware` — Integration platforms, MCP servers
- `output` — Dashboards, reports, notifications

#### Flow Steps

For each step, define:

```yaml
step:
  number: 1
  from: "human"
  to: "claude"
  action: "Initiates performance review"
  description: "Sarah, a Brand Analyst at [Prospect], kicks off the quarterly review..."
  data_example: "Review request: Nike brand, Q4 2025"
  duration: "~1 second"
  value_note: "No manual data gathering required"
```

#### Scenario Narrative

Write a clear, specific walkthrough:

```
Step 1: Human Trigger
"Sarah, a Brand Performance Analyst at Centric Brands, needs to review
Q4 performance for the Nike license agreement. She opens the review
dashboard and clicks 'Start Review'..."

Step 2: Contract Analysis
"Claude retrieves the Nike contract PDF and extracts the performance
obligations: minimum $50M revenue, 12% margin requirement, quarterly
reporting deadline..."

Step 3: Data Query
"Claude formulates a query and sends it to Workato DataGenie:
'Get Q4 2025 revenue and gross margin for Nike brand from Snowflake'..."

Step 4: Results & Synthesis
"Snowflake returns the data. Claude compares actuals vs. obligations:
Revenue $52.3M ✓ (exceeded by $2.3M)
Margin 11.2% ⚠️ (0.8% below threshold)..."

Step 5: Insight Delivery
"Claude synthesizes findings into an executive summary with
recommendations: 'Review promotional spend allocation to improve
margin performance...'"
```
