# Improve Codebase Architecture

Find and propose "deepening opportunities" - places where shallow modules can be turned into deep ones, improving testability, maintainability and AI-navigability.

## Glossary

See [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) for shared vocabulary:

- **Module**: Unit of code with an interface and implementation
- **Interface**: What callers see (API, types, function signatures)
- **Implementation**: Hidden internals
- **Depth**: Ratio of implementation complexity to interface simplicity
- **Seam**: Boundary where dependencies can be substituted
- **Adapter**: Thin wrapper making an external dependency conform to an internal interface
- **Leverage**: Capability delivered per unit of interface complexity
- **Locality**: How much of a change is contained within one module

## Process

### 1. Explore

Scan the codebase for:

- **Shallow modules** - lots of interface, little implementation
- **Pass-through methods** - functions that just delegate
- **Leaky abstractions** - internal details exposed in interfaces
- **Missing seams** - places where testing requires the real dependency
- **Scattered changes** - features that touch many modules (low locality)

Use the domain glossary to understand module naming and boundaries.

### 2. Present candidates

For each opportunity, explain:

1. **What's shallow** - the current state
2. **What deepening looks like** - the proposed improvement
3. **Risk** - what could go wrong
4. **Dependencies** - what depends on this (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md) for dependency classification)

### 3. Grilling loop

For each candidate the user is interested in:

1. Present the "Design It Twice" options (see [INTERFACE-DESIGN.md](INTERFACE-DESIGN.md))
2. Quiz the user on trade-offs
3. Agree on approach
4. Document the decision

### 4. Implementation

When the user approves a deepening:

1. Write the regression test at the correct seam **first**
2. Deepen the module
3. Verify tests pass
4. Clean up any adapters or seams that are no longer needed

## What to Look For

Good deepening candidates:

- Modules with many parameters that could be simplified
- Classes with too many public methods
- Functions that require callers to manage state
- Code where adding a feature requires touching 5+ files
- Test files that are harder to read than the implementation

Bad deepening candidates:

- Modules that are already thin wrappers by design (adapters)
- Code that rarely changes
- Interfaces mandated by external APIs
