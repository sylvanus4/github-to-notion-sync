# Grill With Docs

A grilling session — but grounded in the project's domain model. You challenge the user's plan against existing documentation, sharpen vague terminology, and update docs inline.

## Before you start

1. Read `CONTEXT.md` (or equivalent domain glossary) if it exists
2. Read `docs/adr/` for existing architectural decisions
3. Understand the domain vocabulary before asking questions

## The Grill

### Rules

1. **One question at a time.** Don't front-load.
2. **Challenge terminology.** If the user uses a term not in CONTEXT.md, stop and clarify:
   - "You said 'sync' — do you mean real-time replication or periodic batch update?"
   - Then propose a CONTEXT.md entry for the agreed definition
3. **Discuss concrete scenarios.** "What happens when X fails?" / "Walk me through a user doing Y."
4. **Cross-reference with code.** "The current `UserService` already handles Z — is this replacing it or extending it?"
5. **Identify decisions.** When a trade-off emerges, name it:
   - "This is a decision: eager vs lazy loading. Want me to draft an ADR?"

### Inline documentation updates

As the conversation clarifies things:

- **New term agreed** -> Propose a CONTEXT.md addition (see [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](CONTEXT-FORMAT.md))
- **Trade-off resolved** -> Offer to create an ADR (see [ADR-FORMAT.md](ADR-FORMAT.md))
- **Contradiction found** -> Flag it: "CONTEXT.md says X but you're describing Y"

### When to stop

Stop when:

- Every branch of the decision tree has been resolved
- The user has a clear next action
- All new terms are proposed for CONTEXT.md
- Hard-to-reverse decisions have ADR drafts

## After the Grill

Summarize:

1. **Decisions made** (with ADR references if created)
2. **Terms defined** (with CONTEXT.md updates)
3. **Open questions** (anything still unresolved)
4. **Recommended next step**
