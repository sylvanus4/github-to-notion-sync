  Read today's analysis pipeline signals (screener/analysis outputs) and translate

  Use when the user asks to "convert signals to orders", "signal to order",

# toss-signal-bridge

Bridge analysis pipeline signals to tossctl order previews — the critical link between analysis and execution.

## When to Use

- After `today` pipeline generates BUY/SELL signals
- When user wants to act on pipeline recommendations via Toss
- Preview mode before committing to trades
- Part of the daily pipeline Phase 5.5

## When NOT to Use

- For direct order execution → use `tossinvest-trading`
- For portfolio reconciliation → use `toss-portfolio-recon`
- For risk assessment → use `toss-risk-monitor`

## Prerequisites

- `tossctl` installed and in PATH
- Active authenticated session
- Today's pipeline outputs — prefers `outputs/strategy-cards-{date}.json` (Phase 5b strategy engine); falls back to `outputs/screener-*.json` and `outputs/analysis-*.json`

## SAFETY: Preview Only

This skill NEVER executes orders. It operates entirely within Layer 3 (preview/dry-run) of the tossinvest-trading safety model. All output is informational — the user must explicitly invoke `tossinvest-trading` to execute.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Pipeline Signals

**Preferred source (v1.1+)**: Load strategy cards from the daily strategy engine (Phase 5b):

```bash
cat outputs/strategy-cards-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json
```

Each strategy card provides precise `entry_price`, `stop_loss`, `target_price`, `position_size_pct`, composite `score`, and `signal` (BUY/SELL) backed by a full backtest. Use these directly for order previews — no additional screening needed.

**Fallback**: If strategy cards are not available, load the legacy screener and analysis outputs:

```bash
ls -t outputs/screener-*.json | head -1
ls -t outputs/analysis-*.json | head -1
```

Parse for entries with actionable signals (the screener uses three values):
- **NEUTRAL** (composite_score ≥ 40): favorable setup — potential new positions
- **CAUTION** (score 15–39): mixed technicals — watch only
- **AVOID** (score < 15): unfavorable — potential exits if currently held

### Step 2: Filter Tradeable Symbols

Filter to symbols tradeable on Toss Securities:
- US tickers (NYSE/NASDAQ): direct match
- KRX codes (6-digit numeric): direct match
- Skip ETFs or instruments not supported by Toss

### Step 3: Get Current Prices

For each candidate symbol:

```bash
tossctl quote get <symbol> --output json
```

### Step 4: Check Existing Exposure

```bash
tossctl portfolio positions --output json
```

Cross-reference:
- For NEUTRAL signals: check if already held (avoid doubling)
- For AVOID signals: check if actually held (can't sell what you don't own)

### Step 5: Position Sizing

**When using strategy cards**: Each card includes `position_size_pct` (default 5% of equity) and precise `entry_price`. Calculate share quantity directly:

```
share_qty = (equity × position_size_pct) / entry_price
```

**Legacy fallback**: For screener-based candidates, apply position sizing logic:

```bash
tossctl account summary --output json
```

Calculate:
- Available buying power
- Target position size (e.g., 3-5% of equity per position)
- Share quantity: `target_allocation / current_price`
- FX consideration for US stocks (use `toss-fx-monitor` rate if available)

### Step 6: Prerequisite — Permissions Check (Layer 2)

Before generating any order preview, verify that `tossinvest-trading` permissions are granted for the session. The `toss-signal-bridge` skill itself NEVER executes trades — but order previews still require an active, authenticated session:

```bash
tossctl auth status
```

If the session is not active, prompt the user to authenticate first.

### Step 7: Order Preview (Layer 3 — Dry Run)

For each candidate, generate a dry-run preview using `tossctl order place` **without the `--execute` flag**. This follows Layer 3 of the `tossinvest-trading` 6-layer safety model:

```bash
tossctl order place <buy|sell> <SYMBOL> --qty <N> --limit <PRICE> --output json
```

Without `--execute`, this returns a preview showing estimated cost, fees, and order details — no real order is submitted. This is the correct command; there is no separate `preview` subcommand.

### Step 8: Ranked Presentation

Present all candidates ranked by signal strength, in Korean:

```
🔗 시그널 → 주문 미리보기 (2026-03-24)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
파이프라인 시그널 8개 → 실행 가능 5개

📈 매수 후보:

```

### Step 9: Slack Posting (Pipeline Mode)

When invoked as part of the `today` pipeline Phase 5.5, include the preview summary in the Slack thread under "Toss 실행 가능 시그널" section.

## Examples

```
User: 오늘 시그널 브릿지 돌려줘
Agent: toss-signal-bridge 실행 →
  NEUTRAL 시그널 종목 2개 → 주문 프리뷰 생성 (실행 없음):
  - PLTR: 매수 15주 @ $78.20 → 예상 비용 $1,173.00
  - SOFI: 매수 30주 @ $14.80 → 예상 비용 $444.00
  AVOID 시그널 보유 종목 1개 → 매도 프리뷰:
  - TSLA: 매도 5주 @ $245.00 → 예상 수익 $1,225.00

User: toss signal bridge --dry-run
Agent: (runs the full pipeline, generates order previews without execution)

User: /today (with skip-toss not set)
Agent: Phase 5.5에서 자동으로 toss-signal-bridge 실행
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `No active session` | Prompt `tossctl auth login` |
| No pipeline outputs | Inform user to run `today` pipeline first |
| Quote fetch failed | Skip symbol, note in report |
| Insufficient buying power | Flag in report, reduce quantity suggestion |
| Symbol not tradeable on Toss | Skip with note |
