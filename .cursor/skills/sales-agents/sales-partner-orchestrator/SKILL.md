# Sales Partnership / Channel Deal Orchestrator

Structure and track multi-party partner deals by extracting commitments from unstructured communications, detecting follow-up lapses, and maintaining a shared action item registry across ThakiCloud, MSP partners, and end customers.

## When to Use

- Managing a co-proposal with an MSP partner (e.g., Bespin Global, Megazone)
- Tracking action items across multiple parties after a joint meeting
- Detecting stalled partner deals or follow-up lapses
- Preparing status updates for partner deal reviews
- Onboarding a new partner deal into the tracking system

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1 — Ingest Communications

1. For email threads: use `gws-gmail` to fetch recent partner-related emails (search by partner name or deal label).
2. For meeting transcripts: use `meeting-digest` to extract structured meeting notes.
3. For Slack threads: use Slack MCP to read relevant channel threads.
4. Identify the three parties (ThakiCloud, partner, customer) and their representatives.

### Step 2 — Extract Commitments

1. Parse each communication for action items — statements containing commitments, requests, or deliverables. For bilingual communications (Korean + English mixed), extract from both languages and unify duplicates.
2. Apply a confidence threshold: firm commitments ("I will send by Friday" / "금요일까지 보내드리겠습니다") are high-confidence action items. Vague intent ("I'll look into it" / "확인해보겠습니다") should be flagged as `tentative` and require human confirmation before being tracked as real action items.
3. For each action item, identify:
   - **Owner party**: Who committed or was asked (ThakiCloud / partner / customer). If ambiguous ("we" or "우리"), flag for human assignment.
   - **Owner name**: Specific person responsible
   - **Deadline**: Explicit or inferred deadline. If no deadline is stated, set to `null` and flag for human assignment — do not infer arbitrary deadlines.
   - **Source**: Which communication the commitment came from
4. Deduplicate across sources — the same action item may appear in email and meeting notes. Match by semantic similarity, not exact text.

### Step 3 — Detect Blockers

1. Flag action items with no response after 48 hours as potential blockers.
2. Identify circular dependencies (A waits for B, B waits for A).
3. Detect items where the owner party has gone silent.
4. For each blocker, suggest an escalation approach (direct follow-up email, escalate to partner manager, schedule sync call).

### Step 4 — Assess Deal Health

1. Score deal health 0-100 based on:
   - Action item completion rate (weight: 30%)
   - Communication recency — days since last meaningful exchange (weight: 25%)
   - Blocker severity and count (weight: 25%)
   - Forward momentum — are new items being created and completed? (weight: 20%)
2. Assign grade: A (80+), B (60-79), C (40-59), D (<40).
3. Determine trend by comparing to previous health assessment if available.

### Step 5 — Publish Status

1. Generate a deal health card in markdown format.
2. Publish to Notion via `md-to-notion` for persistent tracking.
3. Post blocker alerts to Slack if any critical blockers exist.
4. Persist full output to `outputs/sales-partner/{date}/{deal-slug}/`.

## Constraints

- Never auto-send messages to partners or customers — all external communications require human approval
- Action items must have an identified owner party; unattributable items should be flagged for human assignment
- Deal health scores must follow the documented formula (completion 30%, recency 25%, blockers 25%, momentum 20%) — no ad-hoc weighting
- Blocker escalation suggestions are advisory only — do not execute escalation without human approval
- Limit action item extraction to the most recent 30 days of communications unless explicitly asked for a wider window

## Gotchas

- Partner emails often CC multiple ThakiCloud contacts — deduplicate action items that appear in both individual and group email threads
- Meeting notes from joint meetings may attribute action items ambiguously ("we will do X") — flag these for human clarification rather than guessing the owner party
- MSP partner naming conventions vary (e.g., "Bespin Global" vs "Bespin" vs "BG") — normalize partner names to prevent duplicate deal tracking
- Slack threads may contain informal commitments ("I'll look into it") that are not genuine action items — apply a higher bar for Slack-sourced items than email-sourced ones
- Deal health trends require at least 2 assessment snapshots to calculate — first assessment should show "trend: new" rather than fabricating a direction

## Verification

Before publishing the deal status:
1. Every action item has an owner_party and source attribution
2. Blocker items reference specific blocked action item IDs
3. Deal health score calculation matches the documented weights
4. No external-facing content is included in the Notion/Slack output without human review flag
5. Partner names are normalized consistently across all action items

## Autonomy Level: L2

- **Auto**: Communication ingestion, commitment extraction, blocker detection, health scoring, internal status publishing
- **Human Review Required**: Escalation decisions, partner-facing communications, deal health assessments shared externally
- **Never Auto**: Sending messages to partners or customers, committing resources or timelines

## Integration Points

- **Upstream**: Partner emails, meeting notes, Slack threads
- **Downstream**: Deal health feeds into `sales-deal-prep` for meeting context, and into overall pipeline reporting
- **Harness**: Invoked standalone in `partner-deal` mode of `sales-agent-harness`
